This project is a Geodetic Coordinate Conversion Tool that enables users to convert coordinates between different formats and datums.
The tool supports conversions between decimal degrees, DMS (degrees, minutes, seconds), UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator), 
and ECEF (Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed). It also applies datum transformations using the Helmert transformation method when needed.
